    "text": "We are a quantitative lab. We use large data sets, computer code, and causal inference techniques to study 1) how institutions, incentives, and the environment shape how humans use marine resources, 2) how humans respond to changes in the marine environment and policy landscapes, and 3) how these responses feed back into the system.\nActive projects of inquiry include:\n\nEffectiveness of conservation in the high seas (with John Lynham)\nQuantifying the distributional outcomes of large-scale marine protected areas\nUnderstanding the scales of human mobility at sea\nInvestigating the response of fisheries and shipping industry to hurricanes and tropical storms (with Renato Molina and Keita Abe)\nEvaluating the benefits, if any, of large-scale marine protected areas to pelagic fish species\n\nWorking papers:\n\nSubsidizing the tragedy of the commons: Fuel subsidies modify fishing behavior and drive overfishing. With Christopher Costello & Olivier Deschênes | working paper\nDigital technologies and the study of adaptation in small-scale fisheries. | working paper"

My research investigates how tuna longline fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico respond to the removal of fuel subsidies. By using geospatial analysis and subsidy data, I work to understand and quantify the impacts of policy changes to model potential behavioral shifts in fishing industries. This research builds on interest in environmental governance and community resilience, which I plan to continue exploring through service in the Peace Corps and eventually in environmental law."

Students will also be part of the Earth System Science initiative at the Institute for Data Science and Computing.\nNote that students don’t join the lab to work on specific projects. You will have the opportunity to develop your own research projects, so long as they align with the topics outlined above. Additionally, my PhD students are required to enroll in the PhD Econometrics sequence at the Department of Economics to gain proficiency in causal inference techniques, as well as my Intro to Environmental Data Science class. Students may also opt to gain these skills via independent study or to substitute them for other quantitative skills (e.g. machine learning). All students are expected to be/become proficient in at least one scripting language (R / Python), as well as version control via git and GitHub.\n\n\nI am hoping to recruit up to two fully funded PhD students to start in Fall 2026. Prospective students should contact me well in advance of the application deadline. Please include your CV and a description of your past experience in academic research, as well as your research interests and motivations for pursuing a PhD."

I use modern data science tools and techniques to study the human dimensions of marine conservation and environmental change. Specifically, I leverage extensive vessel-tracking and georeferenced fisheries data to study:\n\nhow institutions, incentives, and the environment shape how humans use marine resources, 2. how humans respond to changes in the marine environment and policy landscapes, and\nhow these responses feed back into the system."
