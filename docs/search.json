Students will also be part of the Earth System Science initiative at the Institute for Data Science and Computing.\nNote that students don’t join the lab to work on specific projects. You will have the opportunity to develop your own research projects, so long as they align with our three pillars. Additionally, my PhD students are required to enroll in the PhD Econometrics sequence at the Department of Economics to gain proficiency in causal inference techniques, as well as my Intro to Environmental Data Science class. Students may also opt to gain these skills via independent study or to substitute them for other quantitative skills (e.g. machine learning). All students are expected to be/become proficient in at least one scripting language (R / Python), as well as version control via git and GitHub.\n\n\nI am hoping to recruit up to two fully funded PhD students to start in Fall 2026. Prospective students should contact me1 well in advance of the application deadline. Please include your CV and a 1-pager (max) description of your past experience in academic research, your research interests, and your motivations for pursuing a PhD."
