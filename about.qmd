## Our Three Pillars

We are a quantitative lab focused on understanding the human dimensions of marine policy and environmental change. We use large data sets, computer code, and causal inference techniques to study how institutions, incentives, and the environment shape human behavior at sea, and how these behaviors feed back into the system. Our work is divided into three topics:

1. The socio-ecological dimensions of large-scale Marine Protected Areas
2. Human responses to changes in the marine environment and policy landscapes
3. The scales of human mobility at sea

Active lines of inquiry include:

- Effectiveness of conservation in the high seas (with John Lynham)
- Quantifying the distributional outcomes of large-scale marine protected areas (with Eugenia Romero)
- Evaluating the benefits, if any, of large-scale marine protected areas to pelagic fish species
- Investigating the response of fisheries and shipping industry to hurricanes and tropical storms (with Renato Molina and Keita Abe)
- Studying fuel subsidy reform in Mexican industrial fisheries
- Understanding the scales of human mobility at sea
