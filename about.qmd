We are a quantitative lab. We use large data sets, computer code, and causal
inference techniques to study 1) how institutions, incentives, and the environment
shape how humans use marine resources, 2) how humans respond to changes in the
marine environment and policy landscapes, and 3) how these responses feed back
into the system.

Active projects of inquiry include:

- Effectiveness of conservation in the high seas (with John Lynham)
- Quantifying the distributional outcomes of large-scale marine protected areas
- Understanding the scales of human mobility at sea
- Investigating the response of fisheries and shipping industry to hurricanes and tropical storms (with Renato Molina and Keita Abe)
- Evaluating the benefits, if any, of large-scale marine protected areas to pelagic fish species

Working papers:

- Subsidizing the tragedy of the commons: Fuel subsidies modify fishing behavior and drive overfishing. *With Christopher Costello & Olivier DeschÃªnes* | [working paper](documents/working_papers/subsidies2_0.pdf)
- Digital technologies and the study of adaptation in small-scale fisheries. | [working paper](documents/working_papers/digital_experiments.pdf)
